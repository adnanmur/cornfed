          <div class="stories-text">Born and raised in Pickerington, Ohio, Eric Tipton began his farming career baling straw for a friend of his grandpa’s who owned a dairy farm. He quickly developed an interest and commitment to the technological advancements needed to improve farming. He has dedicated his life’s work to innovating agriculture and spearheading change to better the agriculture industry.Eric is always asked, what do farmers do when they’re not farming? His answer is simple: farmers plan ahead to make their businesses more efficient to fuel and feed the world. They’re dedicated to investing in innovations to better their equipment, practices to be less wasteful, and tools to increase efficiency.</div>

          <div class="text-block-7">On Ricketts Farm, Inc., innovations in technology allow Eric to grow more with less, feeding sustainability and making sure his farm will be around for generations to come.Innovation goes hand in hand with sustainability. A steward of his land, Eric is focused on protecting his farm’s soil structure, fertilizer and nutrients through innovative practices like utilizing cover crops and adopting no-till. Beyond that, variable rate technologies (VRT) enable efficient and sustainable inputs—such as seed, fertilizer, and chemicals—by controlling distribution as farm machinery moves across a field. Eric is constantly making sure he is using the most up-to-date equipment and technologies on the market.Eric understands advancements in innovation and sustainability have different levels – there’s the field level, the input level, and equally as important but often overlooked, the people behind the scenes. Eric prioritizes creating an environment where his employees feel safe and have the tools they need to be successful, making sure his farm is an appealing place to work.</div>
